      <h3>Chapter 1: Changes</h3>
      <p class="me-row2">During 2024, the current means of communication gave way to a new service provider, a welcoming change. <br>A new era has begun... <br>A whole new world was discovered!</p>
      <p class="me-row2">Some people would say that I have learned and developed into an expert in line with my duties and responsabilities.</p>
      <p class="me-row2">I used my knowledge, experience and skills to provide people with well-educated guidance and training.</p>
      <p class="me-row2">I consider myself fortunate to be a part of positive changes and organizational growth.  I will forever be crateful for each employee, person and organization I had the opportunity to work with during this time.</p>

      <h3>Chapter 2: Challenges</h3>
      <p class="me-row1">During my first introduction to coding, my love for endless possibilities kicked in!</p>
      <p class="me-row1">Late 2022, an exceptional opportunity and challenge presented itself.<br>
         I said goodbye to communication, and somewhat stepped into development.<br></p>

      <p class="me-row1">This was the start of a new chapter in my career…<br>
        I was eager to get started and just as excited to start learning all over again. </p>
      <p class="me-row1">The first part of the year was focused on technical writing and systems training,<br>
        learning the do’s-and-don’ts and best practices to follow to achieve efficient results with the new tasks at hand.</p>

      <h3>The Next Chapters...</h3>
      <p class="me-row2">Each chapter makes a book... 
      each module makes a system!</p>
      <p class="me-row2">Once satisfied with my writing techniques and processes, I set out for a new challenge; training and software manual guides, conveniently available online.</p>

      <p class="me-row2">This is where I started playing with coding again, designing and producing a set of possible outcomes to present our clients with.</p>
      <p class="me-row2">Chapters was rebuilt to modules, and books complimented with online resources. The ideas are still flowing, and the next challenge is on the horizon.</p>
      <p class="me-row2">The next chapters is still unknown, yet the posibilities promises to be endless.</p>
